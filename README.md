# Minecraft Pre-Classic Rust Clients

This is a reimplementation of Minecraft's original test versions made available in today's launcher using the Rust programming language.

> [Pre-Classic](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_pre-Classic) was the initial development phase of Minecraft, in which the very basic mechanics and elements of the game were developed, tested and improved over the period of less than a week—from May 10–16, 2009. It was not originally released to the public, but some versions are now playable via the launcher.
